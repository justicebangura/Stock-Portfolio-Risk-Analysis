# Stock Portfolio Risk Analysis

![Stock Portfolio](http://www.creative-commons-images.com/finance/images/stock-portfolio.jpg)

In this Challenge, I will evaluate the performance among various algorithmic, hedge, and mutual fund portfolios and compare them against the S&P TSX 60 Index.

## Steps

### Import
I imported all necessary files and dependencies.

### Files
- `whale_returns.csv`: Contains returns of some famous "whale" investors' portfolios.
- `algo_returns.csv`: Contains returns from the in-house trading algorithms from Harold's company.
- `sp_tsx_history.csv`: Contains historical closing prices of the S&P TSX 60 Index.

### Data Cleaning
I read the CSV files into DataFrames and performed any necessary data-cleaning steps. After cleaning, I combined all DataFrames into a single DataFrame.

### Quantitative Analysis
I calculated and visualized performance and risk metrics for the portfolios.

### Summary

**How does your portfolio do?**

I created a custom portfolio and compared it against the original imported portfolios. Overall, based on my data analysis, my portfolio seems to perform worse. I'll need to pick better stocks next time!
